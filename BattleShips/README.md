# BattleShips
This is my take on the popular board game but it uses a single console, it has two game modes and it is multiplayer.
<br>The development of this project was driven by unit testing (tests are included in this repo)

<h4>Instructions:</h4>
Follow the on screen instructions to build a custom grid and start a new game. There can be two or more players. In simple mode each player has just two ships, where each ship takes up two adjacent grid positions (either horizontal or vertical) In custom mode, the ship types and quantities can instead be chosen. Take turns to fire at your opponent's ships. The last surviving player is the winner.
<br><h4>Commands:</h4>
Place 2,4,h - places a ship at position 2,2 horizontally (or v for vertically)
<br>fire 3,5 - fires a missile to position 3,5
<br>Leave - removes the current player from the game
<br>Quit - ends the current game and returns to the welcome message
